<h2>10 Ways to Maintain a Balanced Diet Chart</h2>
How to have a balanced diet? Follow the points below
<h3>1. Follow the correct mealtime </h3>
 A diet chart comprises of 5 small meals in a day with a gap of 3 hours between each meal. A gap of more than 3 hours will increase the stress hormones cortisol that will let the body store fat in the belly. If these meals are eaten in a proper time it will keep the cortisol levels in check and thus reducing belly fat. Food eaten at the right time will also help in better digestion.

<h3>2. Be physically active during the day</h3>

If you are physically active during the day it will help you in reducing weight and you will feel less lethargic. If you are inactive and lacking in physical activity than your body requires some weight loss exercises to pump you up.

<h3>4. Replace processed foods with fruits and veggies</h3>

Fruits and vegetables are the natural foods that will help to maintain a healthy diet chart for the body. Sadly, these foods have been replaced by processed foods for example, tinned vegetables or breakfast cereals being the main culprit for weight gain. Processed foods are unhealthy and contain added sugar, salt, and fat. So, include fruits and vegetables that are low in fat content aiding in weight loss.

<h3>5. Include more Proteins </h3>

If you want to lose weight, add more proteins to your diet as protein takes more time and energy to break down in the body. You can include snacks and seeds instead of chips or you can opt for a healthier source of protein from Truweight’s wide range of products. For example, shake-a-day, a whey protein drink that you can make into a fruit pudding or quinoa can be eaten instead of rice.

<h3>6. Include milk and milk products</h3>

Dairy products are the best source of calcium that is essential for healthy bones and is also necessary for regulating muscle contraction. If your calcium intake is inadequate, you might suffer from osteoporosis and various bone diseases. Dairy products that are rich in calcium are low-fat yogurt, cottage cheese, and milk. If you are a person who dislikes dairy products then, have these dairy-free calcium supplements for your diet.

<h3>7. Have the required carbs</h3>

It is wise to choose the required amount of carbs needed for the body. Most of the carbohydrates are present in plant foods like pulses, cereals, and millets. Your healthy diet chart should mainly consist of complex carbohydrates such as whole grains, brown rice, oats, lentils, fruits, and veggies. They are also rich in fiber which keeps you feeling fuller for a longer period of time.

<h3>8. Reduce the fat intake</h3>

Decrease the intake of fats in your diet as too much of it can lead to weight gain and other related health problems. The required amount of fats needed for the body totally depends on the foods that you are consuming. Know the fats that contain essential fatty acids that protect the heart and improve the functions of the immune system.

<h3>9. Cut down sugar in your tea/coffee</h3>

Sugar is the lead villain to increase your waistline in the body. Sugar is addictive like a drug to most of the people, who like to add the sweet sugar to their favorite foods. Too much consumption of sugar may cause diabetes, insulin resistance, heart disease, obesity among many lifestyle disorders.

So, the more salt you eat, the higher your blood pressure and the greater the strain on your heart, arteries, kidneys and brain. This can lead to heart attacks, strokes, dementia, and kidney disease.
